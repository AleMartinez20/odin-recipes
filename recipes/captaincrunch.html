<h2> Description: The Perfect Bowl of Captain Crunch </h2>
<p>As a kid, I always prided myself on how good of a captain crunch cereal bowl I could pour. Here is my unmatched recipe</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk (whichever type you prefer)</li>
        <li>Captain Crunch Cereal Box(with berries of course)</li>
        <li>Bananas (optional)</li>
    </ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Retrieve cold milk from the fridge....actually no, leave it in the fridge. Milk has to be as cold as possible</li>
        <li>Retrieve bowl from wherever you have your bowls....make it a big bowl, treat yourself</li>
        <li>Get box of cereal and pour 2 1/2 cups of captain crunch on to the bowl </li>
        <li>Get banana, peel banana, slice banana into slices, place sliced bananas on to bowl</li>
        <li>Finally! Pour cold milk on to bowl....ratio of milk to cereal? I prefer more cereal than milk but enough milk to where every cereal bit gets some milk lovin'<li> 
    </ol>
